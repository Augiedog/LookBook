# Project Oma LookBook
A site for grandma to collect pictures of the grand kids 

### Setup
First, you'll need a Postgres database to connect to. Follow instructions here to setup the database and save credentials for the next step.

Next create a `.env` file inside of `backend`. It will need to contain the following environment variables (change the values for the database to match what you defined in the previous step)
```
PORT=5000
DBUSERNAME="postgres"
DBPASSWORD="password"
```

Next `cd` into `backend` and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the API.

Next, `cd` into `frontend`, and run `npm install` to install dependencies for the React app.

Finally, in separate terminals, run `npm start` in each folder so that the API and React app are running at the same time.
